And that for me can be reduced in what in a despertar of human consciousness thank you
Well, I'm gonna tell you a story, and she's a yamila.
if they put a woman like that in front of them and tell them to teach her how to read and write
I mean, I don't see him any more than the hands and the eyes, no, and then...
I say pus I have nothing in common neither culture nor language this
Absolutely nothing except that we're women. We're not human beings.
put me in front of her in one at the time I was working in an international organization
and where there were many refugees and she is one of the refugees who was in the countryside and is from Afghanistan
And then they put me in a group of Afghans and I as the teacher didn't
when I realize and I face that because I knew absolutely nothing and everything I had learned
And what I do is I start carrying a picture of my family I said good pus
I'm going to show you who you are then I teach my mom my dad to my sister to my nephews I don't
and the next day she arrives with a photograph of her family
But it was a much deeper and much more humane communication.
It wasn't a verbal communication. It was a communication on another level.
Then what happened to yamila after two years
If I had been with her, I realized that the teacher was her and the student.
It was I was teaching myself how to cook. He was bringing me typical dishes.
I really realized that capacity of what she had lived and that human capacity of how she had risen.
where she was and how she generated and changed her environment around and the problems she had experienced around the war
When I found out about all this and I got the 20th and changed that paradigm that I was the student and she was the teacher.
I also realize that there are a lot of resilient people
who falls down and gets up again and gets up again and veulves to get up just like all the stories of today at night
And that resilience is a unique human capacity that we all have.
But if we have it and all the stories of today night and yamila have shown us over and over again that we are all resilient
And we can all get up again and in a much stronger way I want too
tell them that when I arrived in Mexico after being many years with that experience
I was contacted by a businessman here from jalisco, a highly resilient person who also came from a very strong problematic and institutional
And he tells me you know I'm not giving up and I want to make a difference in jalisco. I want to do something.
and asks me to do two things one to make a diagnosis an analysis of what is the problem as we find ourselves today and another
to create a model or an answer to this problem of poverty and violence that were the two things that most
I didn't say a lot of trouble that got me why how we're going to do all this.
how I could have done it and how we really found it with the big global problems was this scheme.
I found that there were health problems and the most serious that is infant mortality due to health problems
that if we have many cases of children under five who die I find that education
more than 80 percent who do not even finish their studies
Not high school and only a two percent who finish college careers I also find myself with
an economic problem of irregular jobs and no lack of job opportunities and all that implies informal and formal economics
And finally if to this we add the compound of violence not
what we are going to have as a result or as an answer because obviously a childhood in a street situation
at risk of abandoned street that either works on the street or already lives on the street
this problem is global nothing else is up to us but the big challenge was to do something
to compete with us all the stories that we have played today night or that have been touched in some way have touched on some of these themes
and that what was the second challenge was and we have to move from a phase to a phase c
And that the biggest challenge was to make it go from phase to phase b to phase c this is from confidence phase
build skills and develop skills to build agents of change
Because we've been talking all night about how to be agents of change, no, but no one has talked to us about how we can form agents of change.
How are we going to do it if fifty percent apparently formal education is obsolete?
innovative strategies that are really massive if nothing else like more particular things then
